# ipl_rankings
Taking Bee and friend's IPL ranking from 2016/17 and creating it in Python.

Potential additions that come to mind:
- Recency bias weighting
  -- Linear?
  -- Exponential?
- Add performances in other competitions with weighting for their quality
  -- Borrow cricviz weightings on other comps
  -- develop our own?
